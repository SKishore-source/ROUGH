# Problem Statement

India faces a critical emergency response challenge where thousands of accident victims fail to receive timely care during the Golden Hour. Despite advances in healthcare, delayed emergency detection and inefficient dispatch systems continue to cost lives.

According to national accident statistics, India accounts for approximately 11% of global road fatalities, with over 4.6 lakh accidents reported annually. Most emergency response systems rely on manual reporting and static dispatch mechanisms, resulting in delayed intervention when every minute matters.

The two primary bottlenecks are:

- Delayed emergency detection due to dependence on bystanders.
- Inefficient routing of emergency services through traffic congestion, roadblocks, and damaged infrastructure.

These delays significantly reduce the chances of survival and effective treatment.
Every year India loses **1.68 lakh lives** in road and industrial accidents — the majority preventable, not because medicine failed, but because **help arrived too late**.

| Stat | Reality |
|:---|:---|
| India's share of global road deaths | **~11%** |
| Accidents in India (2022) | **4.6 lakh** |
| Victims receiving care within the Golden Hour | **< 20%** |
| Average ambulance response time (national) | **25–30 minutes** |
| Delhi metro response time (2024) | **17+ minutes (and worsening)** |
| Supreme Court ruling (Jan 2025) | **Golden Hour care is a Fundamental Right under Article 21** |

**The law says every person has a right to emergency care within the Golden Hour. The system is physically incapable of delivering it.**

The two bottlenecks are simple but catastrophic:
1. **Detection Delay (5–15 min):** We rely on bystanders to notice and call for help. Victims bleed out while people panic.
2. **Routing Delay (10–20 min):** Ambulances are dispatched to the closest unit by straight-line distance — getting trapped in protests, strikes, damaged roads, and traffic gridlock.
